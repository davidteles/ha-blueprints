# Home Assistant blueprints

Small, well-behaved automations from a real home, each one built to stay polite with the people living there. Import them with one click and fill in your own entities.

| Blueprint | What it does | Import |
|---|---|---|
| **Motion light auto-off, with a pause timer** | Light off after no motion; a timer helper pauses it while you're busy there; after the pause it only turns off if the room is really empty | [![Import](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdavidteles%2Fha-blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fmotion_light_off_with_pause.yaml) |
| **Pause an appliance while a window is open** | Heater / dehumidifier / AC off while the window is open; back on afterwards, only if the automation paused it | [![Import](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdavidteles%2Fha-blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fpause_appliance_while_window_open.yaml) |
| **Alert that clears itself** | Phone alert when a problem sensor stays on; the notification disappears when the problem is gone | [![Import](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdavidteles%2Fha-blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fself_clearing_alert.yaml) |

> The import buttons work once this repository is public.

## Comfort

| Blueprint | What it does | Import |
|---|---|---|
| **Keep rooms cool on hot afternoons** | Hot and nobody home → sunny-side blinds part-way down (plants keep their light); open again when the sun moves on or someone comes home. | [![Import](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdavidteles%2Fha-blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fcomfort%2Fkeep_rooms_cool.yaml) |
| **"Close the windows"** | Warmer outside than in while it's already warm, or colder outside while it's already cool → reminder. | [![Import](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdavidteles%2Fha-blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fcomfort%2Fclose_windows_reminder.yaml) |

## Energy

| Blueprint | What it does | Import |
|---|---|---|
| **Always-on power (night standby)** | Each morning stores the house's lowest night-time draw — what never switches off. Leaves out minutes when the car was charging. | [![Import](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdavidteles%2Fha-blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fenergy%2Fnight_standby_baseline.yaml) |
| **Monthly home energy summary** | On the 1st: last month's electricity and gas, cost and change vs the month before, from long-term statistics. Short push, full report in notifications. | [![Import](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdavidteles%2Fha-blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fenergy%2Fmonthly_energy_summary.yaml) |

## Lights and buttons

| Blueprint | What it does | Import |
|---|---|---|
| **Shower detection turns the bathroom light on** | Mirror light on and humidity rising fast → main light on. Uses a Derivative helper. | [![Import](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdavidteles%2Fha-blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Flights%2Fshower_light.yaml) |
| **One button, several jobs** | Single / double / triple / long press each do something different. Works with any event-entity button; press names are configurable. | [![Import](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdavidteles%2Fha-blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fbuttons%2Fone_button_several_jobs.yaml) |

## Housekeeping

| Blueprint | What it does | Import |
|---|---|---|
| **Reload a cloud integration that has gone mostly offline** | Every 30 min: an integration with most entities unavailable for 30+ min is reloaded, and you're told if it came back. | [![Import](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdavidteles%2Fha-blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fsystem%2Freload_unavailable_integration.yaml) |
| **Restart a smart bulb that dropped offline** | Power-cycles the relay behind a Wi-Fi bulb that went unavailable, then switches the bulb off again. | [![Import](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdavidteles%2Fha-blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fsystem%2Frestart_offline_bulb.yaml) |

## Before you import

Some blueprints need a helper. Create it first under *Settings → Devices & services → Helpers*:

| Blueprint | Helper |
|---|---|
| Motion light auto-off | A **Timer** (e.g. "Entrance auto-off pause"). Add dashboard buttons that start it for 30 min / 1 h / 2 h. |
| Pause an appliance | A **Toggle** (input_boolean, e.g. "Dehumidifier paused by window") |
| Keep rooms cool | A **Toggle** "Blinds lowered for heat" |
| Night standby | A **Number** helper "Night standby power" (0–5000 W, box mode) |
| Shower detection | A **Derivative** sensor on the bathroom humidity (time unit: minutes) |

### Pause buttons for the motion light (dashboard YAML)

```yaml
type: grid
columns: 4
square: false
cards:
  - type: button
    name: 30 min
    icon: mdi:timer-pause-outline
    tap_action:
      action: perform-action
      perform_action: timer.start
      target: { entity_id: timer.entrance_auto_off_pause }
      data: { duration: "00:30:00" }
  # …repeat for 1 h, 2 h, 4 h; a "Resume" button calls timer.cancel
```

## Design rules these follow

- **They never fight people.** If someone takes over by hand, the automation steps back.
- **Alerts clear themselves** when they stop being true, and wait a moment before firing.
- **Nothing hidden.** Every input is described, and the logic is short enough to read.
